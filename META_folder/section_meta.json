    "content": "The Petroleum Act, 1934, is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of petroleum.  Petroleum may be any liquid hydrocarbon or mixture of hydrocarbons, and inflammable mixture (liquid, viscous or solid) containing any hydrocarbon, and includes natural gas and refinery gas.\nThe Indian Petroleum Act, 1899 was passed at a time when the use of petroleum, especially dangerous petroleum or petrol, was limited and with the great developments in the use of petroleum it had become unsuitable in several ways.  The attention of the Government of India was drawn to the inconveniences caused due to the existence in different provinces of separate sets of rules regulating the importation, possession and transport of petroleum.  The Indian Petroleum Act, 1899 did not permit the issue by the Government of India of a set of rules applicable throughout British India, and the only way in which it had been possible to secure uniformity had been made by the issue by Local Governments from time to time of similar rules with the sanction of the Central Government.  This led to consultations of the Local Governments and it was felt necessary to revise the Act in 1925-26.  As a result the Local Governments agreed that the rule-making power should be transferred to the Central Government.  In addition, a number of changes had been suggested.\nThus in order to secure the uniformity, the Central Government was empowered to frame rules applicable throughout India.  The Petroleum Act, 1934, was assented by the then Governor-General on 6-9-1934, and it came into force with effect from 30-3-1937. The aim and object of the Act stated was to consolidate and amend the law relating to import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of Petroleum and other inflammable substances as they existed then.  In addition to the `Preliminary' portion and the final `Supplemental' Chapter, it contained three separate chapters.  Chapter I relating to Control of Petroleum and Chapter II to its testing while Chapter III contained the necessary penal provisions.\nSubsequently due to the political changes in the set up and the prevailing circumstances various Amending Acts and Adaptation Orders had to be passed both in the pre-Independence period and thereafter.\nThis booklet reproducing the Petroleum Act, 1934, with short comments along with Petroleum Rules, 1976 would serve the purpose of having an overall view of the subject in issue.\nA creative feedback from the learned readers, bringing to our notice any mistake, error or omission or discrepancy that might have crept in this book in spite of our sincere efforts to avoid those, is most welcome, for it will help us improve the quality, style and presentation of the book in the forthcoming editions.\n\n\nAn Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of petroleum \n\tWHEREAS it is expedient to consolidate and amend the law relating to import, transport, storage, production, refining and blending of petroleum.  It is hereby enacted as follows:",

    "content": "Unlike the Indian Petroleum Act, 1899, under the present Act of 1934, petroleum has been categorised as \u201cPetroleum Class A\u201d, \u201cPetroleum Class B\u201d and \u201cPetroleum Class C\u201d, depending upon the flash point, but the definition of \u201cpetroleum\u201d remains the same as it was under old Act.\nAs per section 1 of Act 1862, `petroleum' included any product thereof that give off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 100 degrees fahrenheit.  In Act 1868 it included all such rock oil, Rangoon oil, Burma oil, any product of them and any oil, made from petroleum, coal, schist, shale, peat, or other bituminous substance, as gives off inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 100 degree fahrenheit.  A composition used for coating ship's bottoms which contained 33 per cent of petroleum oil and an equal quantity of linseed oil mixed with pigments, gum, etc., so as to form a paint or paste as it gave an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 73 degree fahrenheit, notwithstanding that it was mixed with other ingredients, it was held to be petroleum under Act 1871 and 1879.\n\n\nThe definition of `petroleum' in the Indian Petroleum Act, Act VIII of 1899, was of the categorical kind.  Section 2, defined the term \u201cpetroleum\u201d as follows: \n\u201cpetroleum\u201d includes also- \n\t(i)     the liquids commonly known by the names of rock oil, Rangoon oil, Burma oil, \t\t\tparaffin oil, mineral oil, kerosene, petroline, gasoline, benzine and benzol; \t(ii)     any inflammable liquid which is made from petroleum, coal, schist, peat or any \t\t\tother bituminous substance, or from any product of petroleum; and \n\t(iii)     any liquid, or viscous mixture having in its composition any of the liquids \t\t\taforesaid; \n\t(iv)     but it does not include any oil ordinarily used for lubricating purposes and \t\t\thaving its flashing point at or above two hundred degrees of fahrenheit's \t\t\tthermometer.\" \nThe term \u201cpetroleum\u201d as used in the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928 included crude petroleum oil from petroleum, or from coal, shale, peat or other bituminous substances, and other products of petroleum.  It includes kerosene although it has not been implicitly stated thus under the Petroleum Act as to whether kerosene could be said to be a dangerous petroleum but surely commonsense would suggest that it be included in non-dangerous petroleum.-K.C. Sachdeva v. State, (1976) 2 Cr LJ 1208 p. 1209.\nCinematograph films having nitrocellulose base will fall within definition of `petroleum'.- 1984 AIR 34.

The sumps and enclosures must be kept clean and free from any accumulation of inflammable liquids.\n8) Every enclosed shed for the storage or filling of petroleum Class A and Class B otherwise than in bulk shall be adequately ventilated near the ground level immediately above the walls constructed to prevent leakage of petroleum and also near or in the roof.\n9) (i) Tank vehicles shall be filled, discharged or stabled only in the positions approved for the purpose and shown on the plan attached hereto. An extract of rules 62 to 86 printed in bold etters in the local language and in Hindi and English shall be prominently displayed at each such position.\n(ii) A tank vehicle which does not fully comply with the requirement laid down in Part IV of chapter III of these rules shall not be loaded, unloaded or stabled within the licensed premises.\n10) Every facility for the storage, loading, unloading or pumping of petroleum shall at all times maintain from any other facility, building, boundary fencing or protected works the distances specified in the Tables 1, 2 and 3 \n(a) Table 1 and Table 2 in the case of installation where the total quantity of petroleum Class A and petroleum Class B stored above ground in bulk exceeds 5,000 kilolitres or where the iameter of any tank for the storage of such petroleum exceeds 9 metres or \n(b) Table 3 in the case of installation where only petroleum Class C is stored or where the total quantity of petroleum Class A and petroleum Class B stored above ground in the bulk does not exceed 5,000 kilolitres and the diameter of any tank for storing petroleum Class A or petroleum Class B does not exceed 9 metres. The layouts of all new grass root refineries/installations approved subsequent to the publication of this rule, shall conform to the oil Industry Safety Director\u2019s Standard 118, as amended from time to time. This shall not apply to \nrefineries/installations existing and/or under construction before the publication of the original OISD standard-118. Not withstanding anything herein to the contrary when petroleum is stored in\n\n\nan installation at or near wells, pumping stations, petro-chemical plants or refineries, the concessional distances given in the attached Table 2 shall not apply and no storage tank, the capacity of which exceeds 250 kilolitres and no petroleum storage of filling sheds/area shall be placed nearer then 90 metres to any boiler, furnace of fire. In such an installation all tanks shall be situated in a compact area (a) under a single control, (b) enclosed or capable of being enclosed by one continuous fence and (c) on which there shall be no protected works.",
